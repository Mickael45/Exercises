PART 1: Setup

          -> Make sure you have node install. To do so, run "node -v". If this returns a version number, we're good to good
          -> Branch from this branch to [your-firstname]-basic-js

PART 2: Exercises

          -> Variables: Make the necessary changes to achieve the expected console output. Little bonus at the end if you successfuly 
                        solve the black magic logic.

          -> Types: Nothing really fancy here, but if you pass unexpected types some weird behavior might occur
                    Try to guess the types of the values that are going to be returned by the function before running the file
                    Write your answer then run "node Sessions/Day\ 2/Exercises/types.js" to see the results
                    NO CHEATING !

          -> Object: Follow this link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String
                     Complete the functions I created to get the expected outcome
                     To run this file run "node Sessions/Day\ 2/Exercises/object.js"

          -> Scope: No need to run the code here, just read and take a moment to understand the code. Then answer the questions.
                    Once you answered, feel free to test it out and if some of your answers were wrong, keep them and add your correction one line below
                    To run this file run "node Sessions/Day\ 2/Exercises/scope.js"


          -> Function: Follow the requirements given in the functions.js file and complete the empty functions that are in it.
                       NONE OF MY CODE IS TO BE REMOVED !
                       Only add code in the functions where the "// add your code here" comment is in.
                       At any moment you can test your work and make sure everything's working
                       as expected. To do this move to the /Exercises folder and run "node tests.js".


PART 3:
